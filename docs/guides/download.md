# How to Download Your Purchased Resource

After purchasing one of our scripts through **Tebex**, you’ll need to download it from the official **Cfx.re Asset Portal**.

This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.

---

## Step 1 — Complete Your Purchase

Once you’ve completed your checkout on Tebex (via our store), you’ll receive:

- A **confirmation email** from Tebex with your order details  
- A **Cfx.re Asset** automatically granted to your account  

> ⚠️ Make sure you are logged in to **Tebex** and **Cfx.re** with the **same account** you used during purchase.  
> The asset will only be granted to that specific Cfx.re account.

## Step 2 — Visit the Cfx.re Asset Portal

1. Go to 👉 [https://portal.cfx.re](https://portal.cfx.re)  
2. Log in with your **Cfx.re account** (the same one used for purchase).  
3. In the top navigation bar, click **“Assets”**.

---

## Step 3 — Open “Granted Assets”

1. In the sidebar, click **“Granted Assets”**.  
2. You’ll see a list of all scripts and resources you’ve purchased.  
3. Find the script you bought — it will be listed with the product name.

---

## Step 4 — Download the Resource

1. Click on your purchased script.  
2. On the product page, click the **“Download”** button to get the latest version.  
3. The resource will be downloaded as a `.zip` file — ready to install on your FiveM server.

## Notes

- You can **re-download** the asset anytime from the Cfx.re Portal if updates are released.  
- Updates are distributed automatically through the same portal — you’ll always have access to the latest version.  
- Do **not** share or redistribute the downloaded files.  
  Each asset is tied to your personal Cfx.re account and license key.

## Next Steps

Once you’ve downloaded your resource:

1. Extract the `.zip` file to your server’s `resources/` folder.  
2. Follow the setup instructions in the documentation for your specific script.  
3. Restart your server and enjoy your new resource!
